# 👁️ AI Real-Time Object Detection & Tracking

## 📄 Description
A high-performance computer vision application developed for the **CodeAlpha Artificial Intelligence Internship**. This tool utilizes the **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once) architecture to detect and track objects in real-time through a webcam feed. It features a custom "Dashboard UI" and persistent tracking IDs for monitoring moving objects.

## 🚀 Features
* **Real-Time Detection:** Instantly identifies objects (People, Phones, Vehicles, etc.) with high confidence.
* **Object Tracking:** Assigns unique IDs to objects to track them across frames (meets "Tracking" requirement).
* **Dashboard UI:** Displays a custom overlay with project title and controls.
* **Optimized Performance:** Runs efficiently using the YOLOv8 Nano model.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python 3.11**
* **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** - State-of-the-art Object Detection Model
* **OpenCV** - Computer Vision & Image Processing
* **NumPy** - Matrix Operations
